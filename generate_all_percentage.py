Google Colab - Ready to Run Version (Data Embedded) - All Percentage Version
================================================================================
This script automatically:
1. Installs required dependencies
2. Uses embedded data (no file uploads needed)
3. Generates four figures (all in percentage format)

Generated files (3 comparison plots only):
- figs/mc_null_distribution_comparison.png (Monte Carlo: Bubble % vs |Bubble %|)
- choiceB_scatter_comparison.png (Scatter: Method 1 vs Method 2)
- distribution_no_labels.png (Distribution: Bubble % vs |Bubble %|)

Note: Standalone plots are commented out to avoid duplicates.

Note: All data is embedded directly in this script. No file uploads required!
All figures use percentage/relative format.
