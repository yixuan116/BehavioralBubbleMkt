# Behavioral Bubble Markets Analysis

Empirical analysis of experimental asset bubbles (Choice A vs Choice B) for MGSC 406 Advanced Experimental Design & Statistics course at Chapman University Fall 2025.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes experimental data from two distinct bubble market experiments designed to test the hypothesis that **bubbles are a result of inexperience**. The research investigates whether experienced traders anchor prices closer to fundamentals, leading to diminished or eliminated bubbles.

## Research Question

**Are bubbles a result of inexperience?** 

If bubbles reflect confusion, misunderstanding of fundamental values, or lack of familiarity with trading in laboratory experiments, then repeated exposure should allow subjects to learn and converge toward fundamental pricing as predicted by theory.

## Experimental Design

### Experiment A: Learning Through Repetition
- **Subjects**: 72 undergraduate students (6 sessions of 12 subjects)
- **Structure**: 5 consecutive markets per session
- **Trading**: 15 periods of continuous double-auction trading per market
- **Dividend**: Random dividend each period (0, 8, 28, or 60 francs, equally likely)
- **Initial Endowment**: 600 francs cash + 4 assets per subject
- **Information Treatment**: 
  - Sessions 1-3: Fundamental values displayed on screen
  - Sessions 4-6: Fundamental values hidden (subjects only know dividend rule)

### Experiment B: Professional vs Student Traders
- **Subjects**: 96 participants (undergraduate students + NYSE professional traders)
- **Structure**: 8 sessions of 12 subjects each
- **Trading**: 15 periods of continuous double-auction trading per market
- **Professional Trader Mix**:
  - 2 sessions: 3 professionals + 9 students
  - 2 sessions: 6 professionals + 6 students  
  - 2 sessions: 9 professionals + 3 students
  - 2 sessions: 12 professionals only
